Divide-and-Conquer kernel SVM solver 
*************************************

This package implements the divide-and-conquer kernel SVM solver. 
The package contains three folders: 

1. dcsvm: the main part of DC-SVM. Please see the README file in 
   dcsvm/ for detail usage and examples. 

2. libsvm-3.14-nobias: we modified libsvm-3.14 to solve the SVM 
   problem without the bias term. Our DC-SVM solver is built on
   top of libsvm-3.14-nobias. Please see the README file in 
   libsvm-3.14-nobias/ for the details of our modifications. 

3. data: for running the examples of DC-SVM, we recommend to put
   the training/testing data in this folder. 

4. windows: the windows version for DC-SVM. Currently we only support 
   the early prediction version of DC-SVM. 


This program is written by Cho-Jui Hsieh, Si Si, and Inderjit S. Dhillon.
