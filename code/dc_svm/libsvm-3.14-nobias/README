Given n training samples {x_1, ..., x_n} with corresponding labels
{y_1, ..., y_n}, this program solves the following kernel SVM dual 
problem without bias term:

min_{\alpha} (1/2)(\alpha)^T Q \alpha - \sum (\alpha), 
	    s.t. 0 <=\alpha_i <= C, forall i

where Q_{ij} = y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j). 

===The Modification===
This program is modified from LIBSVM 3.14 by Cho-Jui Hsieh, 
Si Si, and Inderjit S. Dhillon ({cjhsieh,ssi,inderjit} at cs.utexas.edu), 
and the only changes are made in svm.cpp. Currently we only allow 
the C-SVC solver (-s 0). The author takes no responsibility on 
damage or other problems caused.
